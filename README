This is my first ever attempt at creating a NODE.js web app, and also my first time to use github.
To create this app I flowed a tutorial from www.scotch.io written by Chris Sevilleja.


This app was created using a M.E.A.N stack, meaning MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. 


PREREQUISITES----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. download and install MEAN from ( www.mean.io/#!/ )
2. install nodemon so that you can modify files on the fly and have the app updated right away.
-run command (npm install -g nodemon)

HOW TO RUN-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. to start the app run command (nodemon server.js) you should see the message "app listening on port 8080" if it is up and running properly
2. to use app go to your web browser and go to (localhost:8080)
3. to add a new entry simply type a name into the text field then click add
4. to remove an entry check the box next to the entry you wish to delete

OTHER THOUGHTS---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was a test to see if I could implement a web app. 
Due to this it is not by any means a finished polished product.
The mongo database is being hosted on modulus.io so there should already be some sample data to play with. 
Please free to add and remove whatever data you wish.
